 The Autonomous Weeding Robot is a cost-effective and versatile farm vehicle designed to perform a range of agricultural tasks, making advanced technology accessible to small and marginal farmers. The robot is equipped with 15-inch tractor tires, a skid turn mechanism, and can handle a load capacity of approximately 450 kg. Priced at around 45,000 INR, it offers a low-cost solution for essential farm activities such as threshing, spraying fertilizers, grass cutting, and load transmission. Powered by an Arduino Uno and a Smart 13D Motor Driver, the robot operates using a 24V, 120Ah battery and a 24V, 250W gear motor. It features a Bluetooth HC-05 module for wireless communication, allowing farmers to control the robot via a user-friendly mobile application. The mobile app provides multiple control options, including manual control, camera-based path following, area calculation for precise path following, and GPS navigation integration. This innovative solution aims to enhance farm efficiency, reduce labor costs, and optimize resource use, ultimately increasing productivity and profitability for small and marginal farmers.
